# ReCoN-Ipsundrum

Inspectable ReCoN-based agents with an optional Humphrey-inspired recurrent persistence (“ipsundrum”) loop and affect-coupled control, plus mechanism-linked indicator assays (goal-directed tasks, exploratory play, familiarity/qualiaphilia, pain-tail, and causal lesions).

## Quick Start: Run in Google Colab (One-Click)

Click the link below to open and run the demonstration notebook directly in Google Colab (no installation required):

**[Open Demo in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/anonymous-authors-42/aaai-spring-2026-recips/blob/main/playground.ipynb)**

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the full experiment suite

`run_experiments.sh` executes the complete pipeline and writes artifacts to `results/` and logs to `logs/`.

```bash
# Full (paper) profile (more seeds; default)
./run_experiments.sh

# Faster smoke run
PROFILE=quick ./run_experiments.sh
```

Note: the script deletes and recreates `results/` and `logs/` at startup.

## Run tests

```bash
./run_pytest.sh
```

## Repository layout

- `core/`: ReCoN primitives and Ipsundrum(+affect) dynamics.
- `experiments/`: Assays and figure generation (used by `run_experiments.sh`).
- `analysis/`: “Claims-as-code” exports used by the paper and tables.
- `docs/paper-3-v9.tex`: Paper source (optionally includes `results/paper/claims.tex` if present).

## Build the paper PDF (optional)

Requires a LaTeX toolchain (e.g. `latexmk`). Running the experiments will automatically populate paper results.

```bash
cd docs
latexmk -pdf paper-3-v9.tex
```
